<h1>Welcome to docpicture!</h1>
<p>This is the second release of docpicture (release 0.2 on October 31, 2008).  
It is still mostly a proof of concept.
Hopefully, it will grow to meet your needs.</p>
<p>The idea behind docpicture is to be able to embed images inside docstrings.
These images are defined via a domain specific language, easily understood
by people familiar with the field, but much more expressive when viewed as actual
images.   More information can be found on recent entries on 
<a href="http://aroberge.blogspot.com/">my blog</a>.</p>
<p>Simply type</p>
<pre>
python docpicture.py
</pre>
<p>and you should be greeted with a demo.  I encourage you to read the text of
each example to understand what is being done.</p>
