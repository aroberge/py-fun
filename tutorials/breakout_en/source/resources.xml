    There are quite a few free resources we've made use of in creating this
    tutorial.  
    <ul>
      <li>
    First, and foremost, this tutorial was based on 
    <a href="http://billmill.org/static/canvastutorial/index.html">
      Bill Mill's tutorial</a>.</li>
      <li>The editor we use is 
        <a href="http://www.cdolivet.com/editarea/">Editarea</a></li>
    <li>Sound files were obtained from
      <a href="http://bigsamples.free.fr/">Bigfoot of Samples</a></li>
    <li>Icons for buttons are from
      <a href="http://icons.mysitemyway.com/">ICONS etc.</a></li>
    <li>As mentioned before, we use <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>;
      we also use <a href="http://jqueryui.com">jQuery UI</a>.</li>
    <li>The image of the Earth that we used for the background was obtained
      from <a href="http://www.widescreenwallpapers.org/">
            Widescreen Wallpapers</a></li>
    <li>And, of course, this tutorial would not have been possible without
      countless blog posts, references pages, and other tutorials freely
      accessible on the web and generously made by other people.</li>
    </ul>
