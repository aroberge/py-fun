<h1>Welcome to docpicture!</h1>
<p>This is the initial release of docpicture (release 0.1 on October 27, 2008).  
It is at this time just a proof of concept.
Hopefully, it will grow to meet your needs.</p>
<p>The idea behind docpicture is to be able to embed images inside docstrings.
These images are defined via a domain specific language, easily understood
by people familiar with the field, but much more expressive when viewed as actual
images.   More information can be found on recent entries on 
<a href="http://aroberge.blogspot.com/">my blog</a>.</p>
<p>Start your Python interpreter in the directory where this file is located
and type the following, for a demonstration.</p>
<pre>
>>> import fake_turtle
>>> help(fake_turtle)
>>> help(fake_turtle.RawPen.forward)

>>> import docpicture
>>> docpicture.view(fake_turtle)
>>> docpicture.view(fake_turtle.RawPen.forward)
</pre>

<p>That's it for now! Please give me some feedback at
