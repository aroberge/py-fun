Design philosophy
==================

Docpicture should be thought of primarily as an enhanced alternative to the
standard Python help.  As such, it should display information generated
on the fly, with no need to create temporary files (to hold pictures, for
example).

The "no external file" does not preclude embedding already existing files.

Also, give the possibility to generate a single file as output,
instead of a live display.

To do
======

1. include warning when docpicture directive is found, but no corresponding
parser exists.
2. Investigate using the API to reach http://www.websequencediagrams.com/
to embed graphics generated "live".
3. Have graphics generated by parser embedded in file being viewed.  (started).
4. adapt aafigure.
