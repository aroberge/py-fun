Developer Notes
=====================

Parsers (class) should derive from the base class _parser.  
They should only use lowercase letter and use the same name
for the file name (module), the class and the docpicture name, as in
..docpicture:: some_name

To avoid any ambiguity, all svg "defs" should have their id starting
with the parser class.  For example, if the docpicture name is "some_name"
then the svg defs will start with "some_name_"...

This way, if a page contains diagrams built from different parsers,
there will not be any accidental redefinition.
